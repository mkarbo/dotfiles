# Dotfile repository with one-shot install all bash script.

This is a repository containing my dotfiles. Currently I have
- `.bashrc` for bash config
- Multiple `nvim` config files
- `ranger`config and theme
- `.tmux.conf` file to configure tmux with i3 like keybinds and more

# Installation

To install this, run 
* `git clone https://github.com/mkarbo/dotfiles | cd dotfiles | chmod u+x main.sh | ./main.sh`

This will move files into the corresponding subdirectories of the  ~/.config directory and create symlinks in the home directory.
